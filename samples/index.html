<!--
The videos we produce generally fall into one of two styles: Live action or animation (motion graphics). 

Live Action Videos
This style is most effective for things like employment marketing, culture, and interview videos when it’s important to create a personal connection. The best way to accomplish that is by showing real people, genuine interactions, and actual office environments.

Animated Videos
Motion graphics are great for providing explanations in things like product marketing, website intro, or training videos. This type of animation is also handy when you don’t have an adequate setting, or people who can be in the video.
