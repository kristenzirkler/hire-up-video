						<h2>Pre-Production - Talk it Out</h2>
						<p>Taking the time to really understand our clients’ needs, before any filming starts, allows us to use filming time more efficiently and greatly reduce the number of edits and revisions. That means you get your video done faster and at lower cost.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Begin with conversations about your business and your goals for the project.</li>
							<li>Review samples of our work to get an idea of what you’re looking for.</li>
							<li>Create a proposal with more specific samples and a clear outline of the scope-of-work.</li>
							<li>Discuss proposal to make sure we’re all on the same page.</li>
							<li>Once the proposal is approved, set a timeline for production and a final deadline.</li>
